            I thought about my personal heroes quite a bit before writing this post. I look up to different people, living or dead, for many different reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of these characteristics are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Perseverence</li>
            <li>Historical Impact</li>
            <li>Willingness to work hard</li>
            <li>Being true to themselves</li>
            <li>willingness to self sacrifice</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Over the last 100 years no man exemplifies these values for me more than
            Martin Luther King.  He called people to be accountable for the racial
            prejudices that we all carry.   He demonstrated that violence is not the
            best way to create lasting change. And throughout his life he sacrificed
            everything to make the world better.
