        <p>I enjoy browsing reddit for a variety of things. Not only do I use it to keep up with the news and look at memes, but I also use it to learn from communities such as r/askhistorians. One of my favorite communities is r/thesimpsons. On this community people share fun screenshots, and discuss the show.</p>

        <h2>Whalers on the moon bit from futurama</h2>
        <p><a href="https://comb.io/oQFo3m.gif">link to source</a></p>
        <p>This is one of my favorite bits from the show. The cast travels to an amusement park on the moon and goes on a dopey ride that shows what historians in the future think life on the moon may have been like. This is a funny social commentary on how we percieve history as absolute facts, but oftentimes we may be wrong.</p>
