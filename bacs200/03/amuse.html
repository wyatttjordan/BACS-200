        <p>I enjoy browsing reddit for a variety of things. Not only do I use it to keep up with the news and look at memes, but I also use it to learn from communities such as r/askhistorians. One of my favorite communities is r/thesimpsons. On this community people share fun screenshots, and discuss the show.</p>
